1. **Predictable revenue** from subscriptions
2. **Scalable revenue** from commissions  
3. **High-margin revenue** from white-label and services
4. **Recurring revenue** from ongoing partnerships

The key to "crazy massive income" is **not choosing one model, but intelligently layering multiple revenue streams** that complement each other and provide clear value at every price point.

2. Introduce subscription tiers within 3 months
3. Develop white-label offering by month 9
4. Scale professional services as platform matures
